# Linear-Integrated-Circuits-Applications-
A basic project based on using integrated circuits to build a modulating speaker with sound frequency reactive LEDS. Using LM386 a low-voltage audio power amplifier IC, PT2399 a CMOS echo/delay processor IC which includes an ADC circuit and LM3915 which is a LED driver
In today's digital age, where audio consumption is ubiquitous across
various platforms and settings, the fusion of audio and visual
elements have become increasingly prevalent in enhancing the overall
entertainment experience. Traditional audio equalizers provide users
with control over sound parameters, allowing for customization of
audio output to suit personal preferences. However, the incorporation
of dynamic visual feedback synchronized with audio playback adds a
new dimension to this experience, captivating audiences and
immersing them in a multisensory journey. This project introduces an
innovative solution: an audio-responsive LED equalizer system
designed to synchronize LED lighting patterns with the input audio
signal in real-time. By seamlessly blending advanced audio processing
algorithms with smart LED technology, this system aims to create
captivating visual displays that react dynamically to the nuances of
the audio, enriching the overall audio-visual experience across various
contexts, from home entertainment setups to live performances and
beyond
In this project, we propose the development of an innovative
audio-responsive LED equalizer system aimed at enhancing the
audio-visual experience in various settings such as entertainment
venues, home theatre's, and music studios. The system integrates
advanced audio processing algorithms with smart LED technology to
create a dynamic lighting display that reacts in real-time to the input
audio signal
