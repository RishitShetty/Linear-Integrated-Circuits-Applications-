# Linear-Integrated-Circuits-Applications-
A basic project based on using integrated circuits to build a modulating speaker with sound frequency reactive LEDS. Using LM386 a low-voltage audio power amplifier IC, PT2399 a CMOS echo/delay processor IC which includes an ADC circuit and LM3915 which is a LED driver
